\title{
 Two private minimum spanning tree algorithms
}
\description{
  This package provides two methods to compute an almost minimum spanning tree under differential privacy constraints.
}
\details{
  The two main functions offered by the package are laplaceMST and PAMST. They respectively compute spanning trees according to the Laplace and PAMST methods.
